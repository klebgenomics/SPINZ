# Klebsiella pneumoniae genomics for SPINZ study

Genomic analysis to assess the impact of an infection control bundle on _K. pneumoniae_ populations causing sepsis in neonates in an ICU in Zambia. This paper uses data collected as part of the SPINZ study. 

This repository includes data and code from the paper 'Transmission dynamics of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in a neonatal intensive care unit in Zambia before and after an infection control bundle', Phillips LT et al, MedRxiv 2025.

Output phylogenetic trees are in `output_trees/`, single nucleotide variant distances are in `output_snv_distances/` and cluster estimates in `output_clusters/`

Additional data needed to create figures or tables is in `data/` 

## Figures and tables from the paper

The directories `figures/` and `tables/` contain all the figures and tables from the paper, including supplementary. The code to generate these is in the `Data_analysis_SPINZ.Rmd` R markdown file, and a knitR file showing the executed code is in `Data_analysis_SPINZ.html`.
